# owners-nfts

This project is only to get the owners of specific collection in opensea using Selenium with Pyrhon.

For different collections you need to change in app.py:
official_collection_url = 'https://opensea.io/collection/bookers-oficial'

Steps:

1. Install Python

3. Install the requirements
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Download chromedriver.exe for Selenium

5. Run and take a coffee
   python app.py
